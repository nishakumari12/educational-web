        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
        <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental web technology that is used to enhance the appearance and presentation of HTML documents. This course overview aims to provide beginners with a comprehensive understanding of CSS and equip them with the skills necessary to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages.
            <br><br>
            The course begins with an introduction to CSS, explaining its role in separating the content and presentation layers of a web page. Students will learn about the various ways to include CSS in their HTML documents, including inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets. They will also understand the syntax and basic structure of CSS rules and selectors.
            
            Next, the course delves into the core concepts of CSS styling. Students will explore different types of CSS selectors, such as element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors. They will learn how to apply styles to specific elements and target multiple elements simultaneously. The course also covers the concept of inheritance and how it affects the application of styles across an HTML document.
            
            As the course progresses, students will gain a deeper understanding of CSS properties and values. They will learn how to modify text properties, such as font size, color, and alignment, to create visually appealing typography. Additionally, they will explore box properties, including width, height, padding, margin, and borders, to control the layout and spacing of elements on a web page.
            <br><br>
            The course then moves on to more advanced CSS topics, such as CSS positioning and layout. Students will discover different positioning schemes, such as static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning, and understand how they impact the placement of elements on a web page. They will also explore the concept of CSS floats and learn how to create multi-column layouts using CSS.
            
            In addition to basic styling, the course covers CSS3, the latest version of CSS that introduces new features and enhancements. Students will learn about CSS3 transitions, animations, and transformations, enabling them to create dynamic and interactive elements on their web pages. They will also explore CSS3 media queries, which allow for responsive web design, ensuring that web pages adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
            
            Throughout the course, students will have hands-on practice through coding exercises and projects. They will apply the concepts learned to create visually appealing web pages, experiment with different CSS properties, and solve real-world design challenges. Additionally, they will be encouraged to explore online resources and references to expand their knowledge and stay updated with the latest CSS trends and techniques.
            <br><br>
            By the end of the course, students will have a solid foundation in CSS and be capable of transforming basic HTML documents into visually engaging and professional-looking web pages. They will understand the principles of effective styling, be familiar with a wide range of CSS properties and selectors, and have the ability to troubleshoot common CSS issues. This course aims to empower beginners with the essential skills and knowledge to embark on their journey as web designers or front-end developers.</p>
